# Monoeye - monokai, except gundam 

Like alot of folks, I too started using the Monokai color theme as my default scheme in my various editors and terminal emulators. Perhabs unlike alot of folks, however, I became fascinated with why it was such an excellent pallette.

I don't think I found a universal answer here, but I certainly think I discovered why it was such an alluring scheme for my personally: it reminded me of the vivid and beautiful colors of one of my favorite series of all time, Mobile Suit Gundam.

This is still a work in progress - I'm not a fan, personally, of jet-black backgrounds - so I'm going to find a better color to use. 

Besides that, there are some other things I need to work out, but please be patient because I'm still sort of trying to figure out the basics of base16 color schemes.
