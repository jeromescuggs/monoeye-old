# Monoeye - monokai, except gundam 

Like alot of folks, I too started using the Monokai color theme as my default scheme in my various editors and terminal emulators. Perhabs unlike alot of folks, however, I became fascinated with why it was such an excellent pallette.

I don't think I found a universal answer here, but I certainly think I discovered why it was such an alluring scheme for my personally: it reminded me of the vivid and beautiful colors of one of my favorite series of all time, Mobile Suit Gundam.
